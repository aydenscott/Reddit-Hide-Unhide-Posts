# Reddit-Hide-Unhide-Posts
## Overview
These two programs are really simple browser automation scripts I made for Reddit. Unhide.py is the original one that was useful to me and Hide.py was only created because I ran out of hidden posts to test Unhide.py on. 

## Differences
As should be clear from their name, Unhide.py navigates to your profile and unhides all your hidden posts while Hide.py stays on the front page to hide posts. Another difference between the scripts is that Hide.py is infinite and will not stop on its own since it could hide posts forever. Unhide.py, however, will stop once it detects there are no more hidden posts.

## Usage
For these two programs, the only thing the user must change is to input their own username and password for Reddit in order to login properly. The user may also tweak the time.sleep() values and position in order to speed up the program as some user's computers may be more robust.
